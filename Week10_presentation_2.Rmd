# 🗺️ Introduction
## 📡 Remote sensing data

**Remote sensing data** are the reflected energy from the earth collected by remote sensors carried by a satellite or an aircraft. 

Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency  provides a hotspot product taken from the **Himawari-8** satellite.

## 🎯 Research questions

.monash-blue[(1) Can we detect **bushfire ignitions** from hotspot data?]
 
.monash-blue[(2) Can we accurately predict the **causes** of bushfires during the 2019-2020 Australia bushfire season?]

---
# 📚 Literature review

**Loboda and Csiszar (2007)**

* Fire Spread Reconstruction (**FSR**)
* Clustered hotspots in a temporal manner to detect the bushfire ignitions

**Read, Duff, and Taylor (2018)**: 


* Fitted a logistic regression generalised additive model to lightning-caused ignitions  in Victoria
* Used weather conditions, vegetation types, topographic information and environmental impact of human activities as covariates

# 💻 Data wrangling
## Detect bushfire ignitions from hotspot data

.font_my[
We developd a spatio-temporal clustering algorithm to track bushfires from noisy satellite hotspot data.
]

--

1️⃣ Divide hotspots into different blocks
.font_my_2[
$$[max(t-24, 1), t], t = 1,2,...,T~(hours)$$
]

--

2️⃣ Cluster hotspots in each block

.font_my_2[
* Connect two nodes if geodesic between two nodes <= 3km.
* A connected component is a cluster.
]

--

3️⃣ Update the clustering results recursively

.font_my_2[
* Start from the second hour, till the end.
* If a hotspot is also in the last hour block, update its membership. And then hotspots who share the component with it will also be updated.
]

--

4️⃣ Compute ignition locations

## Data integration

.font_my[
🚀 Used **`raster`** to extract values in **Grid** format data by projecting the bushfire ignitions on the grid:] 

.font_my_2[
  - Forest type, forest height class, forest crown cover and average daily wind speed
]

<br>

--

.font_my[
🚀 Used **`sf`** to calculate the geodesic in **Simple features GIS** data for every bushfire ignition: ]

.font_my_2[
  - Proximity to the nearest CFA station, the nearest camping site and the nearest road
]

<br>

--

.font_my[
🚀 Used **`tidyverse`** to summarize the weather statistics:]

.font_my_2[
  - Temperature, rainfall, solar exposure and wind speed
  - 1-day average, 7-day average, ..., 2-year average
]

# 📐 Modelling

.monash-blue[We used a **random forest** model to classify different causes of bushfire ignition. ]



.font_my_2[
**Random forest** (Breiman, 2001) is an ensemble learning method for building tree-based prediction models. It generates a certain number of decision trees by using the bootstrap aggregating technique and take the majority vote in the case of decision trees as the prediction.

.font_my_2[
We needed to select the most important features out of 55, but the global variable importance could be bias and misleading.]

.font_my[
We used **`lime`**  
- Assumes machine learning models are linear at the local scope
]

.font_my[

1️⃣ Randomly sample data points around an given observation

2️⃣ Pass sample data points to the model to obtain predictions

3️⃣ Fit a lasso regression on the predictions with the sample data points

4️⃣ Select the most important variables from the regularization path

5️⃣ repeat 1️⃣-4️⃣ for 100 observations. Variables being selected most frequently are most important . We kept the top 10 most important variables.

- 138 bushfires caused by accidents which took up 14% of the total fires. Most of them were ignited in March.

# 📜 Discussion
## Policy implication

.font_my[
<!-- - Our prediction may help CFA and FFMV to improve fuel management in remote area. -->
- CFA and FFMV may need to consider delivering planned burns on a larger scale in remote areas of Victoria to reduce the risk of lightning-ignited bushfire.
- CFA may need to reveal the motivations behind the rose of the number of accident-caused bushfire in March 2020 to reduce the controllable impact on bushfire ignition.
- Our research shows arson was unlikely to be the main cause. Public needs to be cautious with controversial claims that have little evidence support. Don't be a part of the disinformation campaign.

# 📜 Contributions
## Summary

1. Algorithm to detect bushfire ignition from hotspot data
2. Model to predict the cause of bushfire ignition
3. Prediction of the causes of the 2019-2020 Australia bushfires
4. A complete and adaptable workflow for monitoring and understanding new ignition from hotspot data

#❓ Extension
## Risk of bushfire ignited by different methods

Using the lightning-ignited bushfire as an example, our model only produced $$P(L|S,\mathcal{F})$$
where $L$ = the bushfire ignited by lightning, $S$ = the bushfire ignited and $\mathcal{F}$ is other information of the ignition, such as location, time, weather conditions, etc.

A future extension would be predicting $P(S|\mathcal{F})$ and combining this model to produce

$$P(L,S|\mathcal{F}) = P(L|S,\mathcal{F})P(S|\mathcal{F})$$

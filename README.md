## Topic

Using Remote Sensing Data to Understand Fire Ignition During the 2019-2020 Australia Bushfire Season

## Abstract

The 2019-2020 Australia bushfires, compared with other major bushfires in history, had a more devastating impact on the environment and properties. The availability of remote sensing data provided us with an opportunity to predict the cause of this bushfire season. We developed a spatiotemporal clustering algorithm to detect bushfire ignitions from hotspot data. We fitted a random forest model to classify the causes of historical bushfire ignitions in Victoria, Australia. The final model showed good predictive ability with 90.5% accuracy in lightning-caused bushfires and 74.95% overall accuracy. We predicted the causes of 2019-2020 Australia bushfires using the model and found lightning was the main cause (82%), while arson only took up a fraction of the total cases (3.62%). The clustering algorithm and the model used in this research could allow fire managers to more easily monitor and investigate bushfires from satellite hotpot data.
